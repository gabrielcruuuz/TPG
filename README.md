I choose to fetch all the pages from the openlibrary API at once to be able to create a input search field by title

As far I understood from openlibrary API it's like a wikipedia so anyone can contirbute to the data there, because of this some of requests for the https://openlibrary.org/works/{BookId}.json don't always return the same data, because of this some of the
books details will not have the description infomration or even the cover image.

In the project I'm using Stephen King author. A good example of data is the book Chamber of Horrors ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e903ca3-7d3f-43e8-b1a3-5830dd78c46c)

Their stories range from grisly supernatural revenge (\"The Squaw\") to black humour of a fantastic nature (\"Edifice Complex\") and the mystery and menace of fiendish possession (\"The Night of the Tiger\").\r\n\r\nThe collection encompasses recognised masterpieces of the genre such as H.P. Lovecraft's \"The Dunwich Horror\" - a sustained evocation of monstrous violence in a sleepy mid-Western town - as well as stories by famous authors not usually associated with this type of fiction - H. G. Wells and Robert Silverberg for example.\r\n\r\nWithin this *Chamber of Horrors* also lurk haunted houses such as H. Russell Wakefield's \"The Red Lodge\", psychological tortures of a peculiarly unpleasant kind, as in \"The Cloth of Madness\" by Seabury Quinn, and the masterful use of understatement and surprise endings in stories by M. R. James, Rudyard Kipling and Robert Aickman.\r\n\r\nFrom underwater monsters to bloodthirsty ghouls, from the evil that lies just beneath the surface of domestic comfort and security to cannibalism twenty-first- century style, this chilling compendium of terror is calculated to send a shiver down the spine of the most hardened devotee of horror fiction.", "subjects": ["Horror stories", "horror short stories", "Fiction, anthologies (multiple authors)"], "latest_revision": 7, "revision": 7, "created": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2019-03-13T13:28:14.231313"}, "last_modified": {"type": "/type/datetime", "value": "2024-09-02T07:38:48.718327"}}

And a bad example is the book Później where you don't have almost any data ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c29bea7d-e92f-4f11-b8c6-362632157e85)
